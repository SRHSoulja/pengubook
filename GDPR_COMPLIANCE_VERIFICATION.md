# GDPR Compliance Verification

## Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Feature:** GDPR-compliant data export and account deletion
**Compliance:** Article 15 (Right to Access) + Article 17 (Right to be Forgotten)

## Legal Requirements

### GDPR Article 15: Right to Access
> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data.

### GDPR Article 17: Right to be Forgotten
> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay.

## Endpoints Created

### 1. `POST /api/users/privacy/export`

**Purpose:** Export all user data in machine-readable format (JSON)

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Authentication required (`withAuth`)
- ✅ Rate limited to 3 requests per hour (prevents abuse)
- ✅ Security logging of export requests
- ✅ IP address tracking
- ✅ Sensitive tokens excluded from export

**Data Included:**
- User profile (all fields)
- Posts with engagement (likes, comments, reactions, shares, edits, bookmarks)
- Comments with post context
- Likes, reactions, shares, bookmarks
- Social connections (followers, following, friends)
- Blocks (initiated and received)
- Messages sent (content, timestamps)
- Message reactions and read receipts
- Notifications (sent and received)
- Tips (given and received with transaction hashes)
- Achievements
- Activities and streaks
- Community memberships and moderator roles
- Reports submitted and received
- Muted phrases and hidden tokens
- File uploads
- Admin actions (if applicable)
- OAuth accounts (provider info only, no tokens)
- Active sessions (metadata only, no session tokens)
- Ad interactions and ads created

**Excluded for Security:**
- Session tokens
- OAuth access/refresh tokens
- CSRF tokens
- Password hashes (N/A for wallet auth)
- Other users' private information

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "exportDate": "2025-10-07T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { /* complete user object */ },
  "metadata": {
    "postsCount": 42,
    "commentsCount": 156,
    "likesCount": 89,
    "followersCount": 23,
    "followingCount": 45,
    "bookmarksCount": 12,
    "tipsGivenCount": 5,
    "tipsReceivedCount": 8,
    "achievementsCount": 7,
    "uploadsCount": 15
  }
}
```

### 2. `POST /api/users/privacy/delete`

**Purpose:** Delete user account and anonymize related data

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Authentication required (`withAuth`)
- ✅ CSRF protection (`withDatabaseCSRFProtection`)
- ✅ Rate limited to 1 request per 24 hours (prevents accidental deletion)
- ✅ Confirmation phrase required: `"DELETE MY ACCOUNT"`
- ✅ Transaction-based deletion (atomic operation)
- ✅ Security logging of deletion requests

**Deletion Strategy:**

#### Complete Deletion (Personal Data)
- Messages (private conversations)
- Message reactions and read receipts
- Notifications (sent and received)
- Bookmarks
- Likes, reactions, shares
- Follows and friendships
- Blocks
- Activities and streaks
- User achievements
- Community memberships and moderator roles
- Reports submitted
- Muted phrases and hidden tokens
- Ad interactions and advertisements
- File uploads
- Contact submissions and project applications
- Auth attempts and nonces
- OAuth accounts
- Sessions (active and revoked)
- Admin actions (if admin user)
- User profile

#### Anonymization (Community Integrity)
- **Posts:** Author changed to `deleted-user`, content preserved
- **Comments:** Author changed to `deleted-user`, content preserved
- **Post edits:** Editor changed to `deleted-user`
- **Tips:** Message changed to `[deleted]`, transaction hash preserved (legal requirement)

**Why Anonymize vs Delete?**
- **Community integrity:** Deleted posts would break conversation threads
- **Legal compliance:** Tips must maintain transaction records for tax purposes
- **Data minimization:** Only PII is removed, content can remain

**Special "Deleted User" Account:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'deleted-user',
  username: 'deleted',
  displayName: '[Deleted User]',
  bio: 'This user account has been deleted',
  avatar: null,
  walletAddress: null,
  email: null
}
```

**Confirmation Required:**
```json
{
  "confirmationPhrase": "DELETE MY ACCOUNT"
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account deleted successfully. All personal data has been removed.",
  "deletedAt": "2025-10-07T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Production Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security logging verified
- [ ] Rate limits configured correctly
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Transaction rollback tested
- [ ] Database backups enabled

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Metrics to Track:**
1. Export request frequency
2. Deletion request frequency
3. Failed deletion attempts (constraint errors)
4. Average export response time
5. Rate limit hits

**Alerts:**
- Spike in deletion requests (potential data breach)
- High failure rate for deletions (database issue)
- Export requests exceeding rate limits (abuse)

### Support Procedures

**User Requests Deletion:**
1. Direct user to Settings → Privacy → Delete Account
2. User clicks "Export Data" first (recommended)
3. User clicks "Delete Account"
4. User enters confirmation phrase: `DELETE MY ACCOUNT`
5. User submits with CSRF token
6. Account deleted within 5 seconds

**Manual Deletion Required (Edge Cases):**
- Foreign key constraint errors
- Database transaction failures
- User unable to authenticate (account locked)

Contact: support@pengubook.com

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Disable Endpoints (Immediate):**
   ```typescript
   // In route.ts files, add at top:
   return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Temporarily disabled' }, { status: 503 })
   ```

2. **Database Restoration:**
   - Use automated backups (retained 30 days)
   - Restore specific user records if deletion was erroneous
   - Contact DBA for point-in-time recovery

3. **Code Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   # Vercel auto-deploys
   ```
