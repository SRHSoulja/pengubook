# 🚀 START HERE - PeBloq Railway Migration

## ✅ I've Created All The Code!

All service files, configs, and structure are ready. You just need to install dependencies.

## ⚠️ Your NPM Has Issues

Error: `Maximum call stack size exceeded`

This is a known Windows/WSL npm bug. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 FIX NPM (Choose One)

### Option 1: Clear Cache (Fastest)
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

### Option 2: Update NPM
```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Option 3: Restart Terminal
Close VSCode terminal and open a new one, or restart WSL.

## 📦 THEN: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd pebloq-mono/services/api
npm install

cd ../socket
npm install

cd ../..
npx prisma generate --schema=packages/prisma/schema.prisma
```

## 🚀 THEN: Test Services

### Terminal 1:
```bash
cd services/api
npm run dev
```
Should see: `🚀 PeBloq API ready at http://0.0.0.0:4000`

### Terminal 2:
```bash
cd services/socket
npm run dev
```
Should see: `🔌 PeBloq Socket.IO server ready at http://localhost:4001`

### Test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:4001/health
```

## 📁 Files I Created

✅ services/api/package.json
✅ services/api/tsconfig.json
✅ services/api/src/index.ts
✅ services/socket/package.json
✅ services/socket/tsconfig.json
✅ services/socket/src/index.ts
✅ packages/prisma/schema.prisma
✅ .env (with all your credentials)

## 🎯 What Happens Next

Once services are running, ping me and I'll:
1. Migrate all 116 API routes to Fastify
2. Create the Worker service (background jobs)
3. Migrate the Next.js frontend
4. Create Railway deployment configs

## 💬 Need Help?

Just tell me:
- "npm is fixed, services installed" - I'll continue migration
- "still broken" - I'll help debug
- "skip this, show me something else" - I'll explain alternatives

**Try: `npm cache clean --force` then install!**
