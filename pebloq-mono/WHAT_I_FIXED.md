# What I Fixed - Prisma Schema Update

## The Problem You Had

When running `npx prisma generate`, you got:
```
Error: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

## Root Cause

The Prisma schema had this:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../../node_modules/.prisma/client"  ← This was the problem
}
```

The custom `output` path was causing Prisma to receive an undefined value when trying to resolve the path, especially when running from Windows npm on WSL files.

## The Fix

I removed the custom output path:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  # output line removed - using default location
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Default path resolution**: Prisma now uses its built-in default location (`node_modules/@prisma/client`) which it can reliably resolve
2. **No cross-OS path issues**: Default location works the same on Windows, WSL, Linux, and macOS
3. **Simpler configuration**: Less complexity = fewer failure points

## File Changed

**Location**: `pebloq-mono/packages/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Before** (lines 1-4):
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../../node_modules/.prisma/client"
}
```

**After** (lines 1-3):
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

## What You Need to Do Now

Since the schema is fixed, you just need to run the generate command from WSL terminal (not Windows):

```bash
# Open Ubuntu terminal
wsl

# Navigate to API service
cd ~/PenguBook/pebloq-mono/services/api

# Generate Prisma client (this should work now!)
npx prisma generate --schema=../../packages/prisma/schema.prisma

# Start the API
npm run dev
```

## Expected Success

### Prisma Generation:
```
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from ../../packages/prisma/schema.prisma

✔ Generated Prisma Client (5.x.x | library) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 123ms

You can now start using Prisma Client in your code:
```

### API Startup:
```
[INFO] Prisma schema loaded from ../../packages/prisma/schema.prisma
[INFO] 🚀 PeBloq API ready at http://0.0.0.0:4000
[INFO] 📊 Health check: http://0.0.0.0:4000/health
[INFO]
[INFO] 📋 Available routes:
[INFO]   🔐 /auth - Authentication (wallet login, nonce, OAuth)
[INFO]   📝 /posts - Posts (CRUD, likes, comments)
[INFO]   👤 /users - Users (profile, search, follow)
[INFO]   📤 /upload - Uploads (Cloudinary direct upload)
[INFO]   💬 /comments - Comments (create, list, delete)
[INFO]   🔔 /notifications - Notifications (list, mark read)
[INFO]   👥 /communities - Communities (create, join, members)
```

## Why Use Ubuntu Terminal?

The Windows npm command (`npm.cmd` from `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`) has issues with:
- UNC paths like `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\...`
- Symlinks in WSL filesystem
- Path resolution for nested node_modules

The Ubuntu terminal uses the **WSL-native npm** which doesn't have these issues.

## Verification

After running the commands, verify Prisma generated correctly:
```bash
# Should exist and contain Prisma client code
ls -la node_modules/@prisma/client

# Should show main index file
ls node_modules/@prisma/client/index.d.ts
```

## Next Steps After Success

1. **Test health endpoint**: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`
2. **Test auth endpoint**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/nonce -d '{"walletAddress":"0x123..."}'`
3. **Review API routes**: See `services/api/src/routes/` for all available endpoints
4. **Continue migration**: See PROGRESS.md for remaining routes to implement

---

**TLDR**: Removed problematic `output` path from Prisma schema. Now run `npx prisma generate` from Ubuntu terminal and it should work! ✅
