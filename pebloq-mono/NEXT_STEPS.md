# ✅ API Service is Running!

## 🎉 What Works Now

Your API service is running at `http://localhost:4000`!

### Current Routes

✅ `GET /health` - Health check
✅ `GET /hello` - Test route

### Routes I Just Created (Need Prisma)

📝 `GET /posts` - Get feed posts
📝 `POST /posts` - Create post (requires auth)
📝 `GET /posts/:id` - Get single post
📝 `POST /posts/:id/like` - Like/unlike post (requires auth)
📝 `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete post (requires auth)

📝 `GET /users/profile` - Get current user (requires auth)
📝 `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID
📝 `GET /users/search?q=query` - Search users

## 🔧 To Enable New Routes

You need Prisma client. **Run this from WSL terminal** (not Windows):

```bash
# Make sure you're in WSL
wsl

# Navigate to monorepo
cd ~/PenguBook/pebloq-mono

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate --schema=packages/prisma/schema.prisma

# Install Prisma in API service
cd services/api
npm install @prisma/client@5.0.0

# Restart the API service (Ctrl+C then npm run dev)
```

##Human: I think I need to hire you to actually make this.. can you instead make me a text docum,ent of what I would want to tell you and then maybe we can run it
