# Try This Alternative Approach

## The Issue

Even with WSL native npm, we're getting "path argument undefined" error. This suggests the issue is with how Prisma resolves relative paths.

## Solution: Generate from packages/prisma

Instead of generating from the API service, let's generate from the packages/prisma directory where the schema lives:

```bash
# 1. Go to the prisma package
cd ~/PenguBook/pebloq-mono/packages/prisma

# 2. Load environment variables
export $(cat ../../.env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)

# 3. Verify DATABASE_URL is set
echo "DATABASE_URL: ${DATABASE_URL:0:40}..."

# 4. Generate Prisma client (no --schema flag needed, it's in current dir)
npx prisma generate

# 5. Go back to API and start it
cd ../../services/api
npm run dev
```

## Why This Should Work

1. **No relative path**: Schema is in current directory, so Prisma doesn't need to resolve `../../packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **Default output**: Prisma will generate to `packages/prisma/node_modules/@prisma/client`
3. **Import still works**: The API's `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'` will find it via Node's module resolution

## Alternative: Use .env file directly

Prisma can load .env files automatically. Create a `.env` symlink in packages/prisma:

```bash
cd ~/PenguBook/pebloq-mono/packages/prisma
ln -s ../../.env .env
npx prisma generate
```

## Last Resort: Check Prisma Version

If still failing, it might be a Prisma bug with version 5.0.0. Try upgrading:

```bash
cd ~/PenguBook/pebloq-mono/services/api
npm install prisma@latest @prisma/client@latest
npx prisma generate --schema=../../packages/prisma/schema.prisma
```

## Debug Mode

Run with debug to see what Prisma is doing:

```bash
DEBUG=* npx prisma generate --schema=../../packages/prisma/schema.prisma
```

This will show exactly where the path resolution is failing.
