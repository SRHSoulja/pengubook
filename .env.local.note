# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT .env vs VERCEL

Your local .env file is for DEVELOPMENT only.

For PRODUCTION on Vercel, you must add these secrets via Vercel dashboard or CLI:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select PenguBook project  
3. Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each secret for "Production" environment

DO NOT copy production secrets to local .env - keep them separate!

See SECRET_ROTATION_GUIDE.md for complete instructions.
